# Scheme Interpreter 

The idea for this project is to develop a Scheme Interpreter using a recursive interpretation and a functional language (Clojure). A wide range of functions and operators that are used natively in Scheme, can be now executed using this interpreter.


### Tests

I've made 177 unit tests in order to test in detail the functionalities of the project, they are located in the test/ folder. In case you want to run those tests, you need to execute the command "lein test" in the repository root.

### Run interpreter

You can run the interpreter by executing the command "lein run" in the repository root. Once the interpreter is running, you can use all the functions that are being interpreted.
The file "demo.scm" contains a large set of scheme functions, you can load the file by running "(load "demo")", once it is loaded, it will provide an output in order to get some insight from the execution of the functions.

You can also load "jarras.scm"
